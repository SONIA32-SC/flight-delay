    "**Predicting flight delays in advance with machine learning models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flight delays or cancellations have become unavoidable in flight travels. The effects of such delays or cancellations lead to travelers losing some money due to missing cruises, prepaid hotel rooms, increased parking fees, cancellation or postponement of business trips and sometimes the additional cost of unplanned air tickets.Travelers also miss vacation and valuable time with family and friends as a result of these delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a model that predicts flight delays will serve as an important tool that could be used by all air travelers to predict flight cancellations in advance and to prevent  loss  associated with flight delays or cancellations. It will also give air travelers ample time to replan meetups, reschedule trips, make safer accommodations choices and prevent them from being stranded due to unplanned flight delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sources  for this project include:\r\n",
    "a.  The 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations (kaggle.com) downloaded from Kaggle. It has about three files airlines.csv, airports.csv and  flights.csv that has information about flight delays in 2015. However, only the flights.csv will be used for this project. This  file has  1048576 rows and 31 columns.\r",
    "b. \n",
    "\r\n",
    "The second file that will be used for this project is the airlinedelaycauses_DelayedFlights.csv also downloaded from Kaggle. It is made up of similar features as the first file. This data has information about flight delays and cancellations in 2008. It has 1936758 rows and 30 columnsc. .\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The supplementary dataset will  be downloaded from Open data @ OurAirports. It is named the airport.csv and has 80559 rows and 18 columns.mns.\r\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project will be met by \n",
    "1. Cleaning and transforming datasets from data sources using Python tools like NumPy and Pandas.\n",
    "2. Cleaned datasets will be merged into one Pandas data frame. This data frame will be analyzed using the same tools. Exploratory data analysis will be conducted and detected trends, patterns and relationships between features will be visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.\n",
    "3. Data features will be preprocessed into forms that can be easily utilized by machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "4. Three machine learning models will be built using different types of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "5. These models will be evaluated and the best performing model will be chosen as the working model of this project. Models will be improved using cross validations or hyperparameter tuning to get the model in the best performing state\n",

    "The datasets of flight delays in 2008 and 2015 were cleaned separately. \n",

    "Dataset of 2008 named,Delay_2008, started with 1936758 rows and 30 columns.\n",
    "Missing columns were handled by dropping irrelevant columns like Cancellationcode column. Missing values were replaced with 0.\n",

    "Dataset of 2015 named, Delay_2015 started with 5819079 rows and 31 columns.\n",
    "Missing values were replaced with 0.\n",

    "Columns with abbreviations like AIRLINE, ORIGIN_AIRPORT and DESTINATION_AIRPORT were repalced with full names from the airlines.csv and airports.csv datasets also downloaded from the Kaggle flight datasets page.\n",

    "\n",
    "The supplementary dataset callled Airports started with 80557 rows and 18 columns.\n",
    "Dropped columns were:\n",
    "1. gps_code column beacause it has missing values but it also has the same information as the ident column which has no missing values\n",
    "2. home_link, wikipedia_link because information about where data was scrapped is not necessary\n",
    "3. local_code because it has missing values but it same information as ident column \n",
    "4. iata_code because is has a lot of of values missing which can not be replaced\n",
    "5. iso_country because it has missing values but missing information is found in iso_region\n",
    "6. municipality because it is irrelevant. iso_region has the required information about where the airport is located\n",
    "7. scheduled_service because its is also no relevant to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values in iso_country column were replaced with country value from iso_region column.\n",
    "missing values in elevation_ft column were replaced with median value of the column. Missing values in municipality column were replaced with 0. Data on only US Airports were selected and saved under the name Airports. Continent column was also dropped because it was no longer relevant.\n",

    "Columns in Delay_2008 were renamed to match columns in Delay_2015. These two datasets were merged with Delay_2008 on top of Delay_2015. This new dataset was named 'Delays'. The cleaned supplementary dataset; 'Airports' was subsequently also merged with Delays using a left join. All missing columns were filled with 0 after the merge.\n",
